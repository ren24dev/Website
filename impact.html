            <h2>Positive and Negative Impact</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Learning Independence while Coping <br> with Sadness</h3>
            <p>
                Parental absence brings both benefits and emotional challenges. On one hand, OFW children often learn self-reliance, responsibility, and maturity. On the other, they struggle with sadness, loneliness, and a constant longing for their parents. Unicef (2017) highlights that prolonged separation affects a child’s overall development, as emotional support and guidance become limited. Without proper supervision, children may face academic, social, and emotional difficulties. Ramos (2020) further adds that although left-behind children become more independent, they may also be easily influenced by others—leading some toward success, while others struggle to stay on track.

            <h3>Responsibility and Resilience amid Loneliness</h3>
            <p>
                Many OFW children grow more resilient, drawing strength from their parents’ sacrifices. They learn to handle responsibilities at a young age. However, despite this positive growth, feelings of isolation persist, especially during important occasions. Capol et al. (2024) noted that even when parents provide materially, emotional separation remains. Abenir (2019) emphasized that while parental absence—especially of a mother—brings emotional challenges, it also forces children to build endurance. They continue moving forward despite vulnerability.

            <h3>Motivated by Sacrifice While Longing <br> for Parental Care</h3>
            <p>
                The sacrifices of OFW parents inspire children to study harder and pursue success. This sense of gratitude fuels their determination to perform well in school. However, the lack of parental support still creates academic struggles, showing how motivation and emotional pain coexist. Lobos et al. (2019) explained that parental absence often leads to loneliness and a deep yearning for love and care, affecting behavior and decision-making. Basco et al. (2025) found that while children appreciate their parents’ sacrifices and aim for high academic achievement, the pressure to succeed may also cause stress, anxiety, and feelings of alienation.
