            <h2>Positive and Negative Impact</h2>
            <h3>Learning Independence while Coping with Sadness</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Parental absence produces both positive and negative outcomes for children of OFW parents. On the positive side, the separation eases family financial struggles, teaches self-reliance, and helps children grow more responsible and independent. On the negative side, it creates emotional distance, feelings of sadness, loneliness, and a deep sense of longing for their parents.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                According to Unicef (2017), the absence of parents can greatly influence a child’s overall development, as proper guidance and emotional support become limited. Prolonged separation often leads to emotional distress, loneliness, and feelings of abandonment, which can further affect a child’s academic, social, and emotional well-being. Additionally, as indicated by Ramos (2020), the absence of their parents can cause a lot of problems that the left-behind children. The children that are left-behind can develop independence and can easily be influenced by other people. In result, many children that go to school may find a proper job, while other can’t.

            <h3>Responsibility and Resilience amid Loneliness</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The sacrifices of OFW parents motivate children to become more responsible, developing a sense of responsibility and toughness in their daily lives. However, despite these positive outcomes, they continue to experience sadness, loneliness, and the emotional weight of their parents’ absence, especially during special occasions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Capol et al. (2024) stated that the feeling of isolation, loneliness, abandonment, deprivation, and the possible health risks. Children often feel emotional separation with their parents, even if their parents provide the material needs of them to fill their absence. Moreover, Abenir (2019) emphasize that the earlier literature review indicates that left-behind children usually deal with more problems when their mother or main caregiver is the one working away, but the impact of family separation has brought both advantages and disadvantages. This could mean that despite being apart from their parent(s), these children have learned to build resilience. While the pain of separation still leaves them vulnerable, they are making efforts to continue with their lives.

            <h3>Motivated by Sacrifice While Longing for Parental Care</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The sacrifices of OFW parents serve as motivation for children to study harder and perform well in school. This sense of inspiration pushes them to value their education and become more determined in their academic responsibilities. However, the absence of maternal care and presence also creates struggles. Without the necessary parental support, children find it difficult to meet their academic needs, showing how motivation and challenges coexist in their educational experiences.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Lobos et al. (2019) emphasize that parental absence tend to cause loneliness and a yearning for parental love and care, affecting children's well-being, decision-making, behavior, and coping mechanisms. Also, Basco et al. (2025) discovered that children whose parents work overseas often grow with a strong feeling of appreciation for their parents' sacrifices, pushing them to attain higher levels of academic achievement. But this motive could also introduce stress, anxiety, and alienation by teachers or figures of authority.
