                <p>
                    Parents' absence because of overseas work brings both good and difficult experiences for children of Overseas Filipino. Being away from their parents often leaves a space in children’s hearts that is not easy to replace. Many kids with OFW parents feel lonely, worried, and unsure about what their future will be. These feelings can affect how well they do in school and how they develop as a person. Furthermore, grandparents or other relatives may take on the role of caregivers, but no matter how much love and effort they give, it is never quite the same as having parents around. In addition, growing up without their parents around changes the way many children form friendships and see the world. Still, being far apart does not always mean losing connection. When parents abroad stay in touch, show patience, and give emotional support, family ties can remain strong despite the distance. At the same time, schools and communities have a big part to play in guiding these children and giving them programs or spaces that help them cope and continue moving forward.

                    Moreover, for some children, this experience becomes a lesson in resilience. They learn independence at a young age and often grow more responsible. For others, however, the absence of a parent may bring challenges, such as struggles with behavior or making sound decisions. This is why guidance and peer support groups play an important role. These spaces give OFW children a chance to express their feelings openly, cope with difficulties, and find a healthier balance in life.
