                <p>
                    Parental absence due to overseas work brings both positive growth and emotional challenges for children of OFWs. While financial support is gained, it often leaves an emotional gap that is difficult to fill. Many children experience loneliness, worry, and uncertainty about their future—feelings that can affect their academic performance, social relationships, and personal development. Grandparents or relatives may take on caregiving roles, but their support can never fully replace a parent’s presence. Despite this, distance does not have to mean disconnection. When OFW parents maintain consistent communication and provide emotional support, family bonds can remain strong. Schools and communities also play a vital role by offering programs and safe spaces where these children can receive guidance and encouragement. For some, this experience fosters resilience, independence, and maturity. For others, it may lead to behavioral struggles or difficulty making sound decisions. This is why emotional support systems—such as counseling, peer groups, and mentorship—are essential. These avenues allow OFW children to express their feelings, manage challenges, and find a healthy balance between strength and vulnerability.
