            <h2>Coping Mechanisms</h2>
                <p>
                    The techniques people frequently use to manage their emotions when they’re under excessive stress or if they experience a traumatic event. It helps people to improve their mental and emotional well-being by adapting to different situations. Additionally, coping mechanisms are used by people as a strategy to handle stress and uncomfortable problems. These actions can assist you in coping with stress in a positive way, but can sometimes be negative.

            <h3>Coping Through Hobbies and Social Connection</h3>
            <br>
                <p>
                    Children of OFW parents use different coping mechanisms to overcome the situation. They engage in hobbies such as watching anime, dancing, reading, and rapping. They also join sports activities and other forms of recreation to divert their attention and avoid dwelling on their situation. In addition, they cope by socializing more often and seeking support from family and friends, which helps them manage their emotions and find happiness.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As explained by Chen and Qu (2021), coping mechanisms are used to adapt or recover from the difficulties that they encounter, and there are two different ways to cope with the situation, the approach coping and avoidant coping. The approach coping mechanisms used emotional support from other people, while the avoidant coping mechanisms involved negative ways to deal with the challenges, and that includes self-blaming, denial and withdrawal. These mechanisms are used to help people to cope with the challenges they face. Additionally, based on the study of Basco et al. (2025), children with Overseas Filipino Workers parents seek emotional support from their relatives and friends. They are the ones who fill the absence of their parents, giving them guidance, support and security. In addition, with the help of other people, the children can have someone that they can rely on, helping them in handling loneliness.

            <h3>Maintaining Connection through Communication</h3>
            <br>
                <p>
                    Communication serves as an important coping mechanism for children of OFW parents. They stay connected with their parents through technology, such as video calls, which helps ease sadness and reduce worries about their parents abroad. They also talk with grandparents and friends when feeling overwhelmed, which provides additional emotional support.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As stated by Magantor (2024), the majority of the children that are apart from their parents due to their parents working overseas used technology to stay connected with their parents and help them to cope with the separation. Communicating with their parents through the use of technology can lessen the emotional challenges that the left-behind children experience. Moreover, seeking help from their families and friends also helps in maintaining their overall emotional and physical well-being during the time when their parents are not physically present.
