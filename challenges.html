                    <h1>Three Common Challenges Faced by OFW Children</h1>

            <h2>Academic Performance</h2>
            <p>
                The achievement of the student acquired from their school is typically measured by classroom performance and test scores. In addition, academic performance is the term that identifies a student's achievements after completing a subject or course at an institution. It is used to know the level of students' learning, mainly from their complied assessment by formative and summative.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Difficulty in Concentration and Focus</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Students who have parents working overseas experience difficulties in concentration and focus. They struggle to concentrate on their studies and become less motivated to pursue school tasks. When there is not enough parental guidance, it becomes hard for them to focus, causing loss of attention, sadness from missing their parents, and lower motivation. In the long run, this lack of support becomes a challenge to their school progress. The absence of an OFW parent negatively affects the learner’s focus, interest, and overall academic performance.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As explained by Annor et al. (2024), there are several reasons for parental absence, such as death, divorce, abandonment, or migration. The absence of one or both parents has a similar effect on children, regardless of the cause. In addition, Mwai (2018) emphasized that adults who experienced emotionally absent parents during their childhood often carry deep sadness and a sense of loss. Even though parents working abroad may provide better financial stability, their children face the emotional consequences of separation, such as loneliness, deprivation, and feelings of abandonment. These consequences affect not only their well-being but also their decisions, behaviors, and coping strategies. Moreover, limited communication and the inability to fully express emotions often create a gap in the relationship between the child and the parent.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Lack of Guidance in Schoolwork</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The lack of parental help makes it difficult for students to manage their time and complete schoolwork. Without parents’ reminders, they need to rely on self-discipline and motivation to finish tasks and meet deadlines. Students find it challenging to study due to the lack of parental guidance and presence, which affects both their motivation and time management. They also struggle with assignments and projects because of limited time and focus, showing how the absence of parental support makes schoolwork harder to handle. The lack of parental guidance causes them to encounter academic challenges.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                According to Zhang (2021), the lack of parental guidance has negative effects on children, particularly in their individual development. Material support alone cannot compensate for parental absence, as children often feel neglected, which can affect their psychological growth and even lead to cognitive problems. Children of OFW parents also tend to score lower in school due to a lack of concentration in the classroom. Furthermore, Mao, Zang, and Zhang (2020) emphasized that long-term parental absence contributes to emotional and behavioral issues, which may result in poor academic performance. Without parents to assist them with assignments or projects, many children experience loneliness and longingness, making it difficult for them to perform well in school.

            <h2>Sozialization</h2>
            <p>
                The term is used to describe how people interact with each other in the society. Socialization includes the process of learning and teaching, acquiring knowledge and skills from the society and imparting knowledge to others. Adding more to the information, socialization is the process where individuals learn different behaviors, norms, and values through peers or other people. Doing activities or having a small chat with each other.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Fear of Abandonment</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Children of OFW parents often experience a fear of abandonment in their social lives. They shared that once they get close to someone, they begin to fear being abandoned. Living in constant fear of people leaving makes it difficult for them to build lasting relationships. This issue affects their capacity to establish and preserve relationships.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                According to Gaspan and Sansot (2024), left-behind children can experience different emotions at once; the absence of their parents can adversely affect their physical and emotional development. The left-behind children often feel alone and abandoned due to the absence of their parents. The Filipino parents choose to take the risk of working abroad in an attempt to provide the needs of their family. Although they meet the financial needs of their family, especially their children, the proper guidance and emotional support are neglected. However, children who can manage their emotions well tend to feel less anxious even when their parents are not around.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Barriers to Social Interaction</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Some children of OFW parents struggle with social connections due to feelings of insecurity and shyness. They find it difficult to communicate and form friendships, making social interaction a significant obstacle. Shyness becomes more evident in the absence of parental support, especially when meeting new people. They often find it hard to talk to those they do not know well, which limits opportunities to build friendships. This difficulty in openness and vulnerability further hinders their ability to establish social relationships.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As explained by Graham and Jordan (2015), children may become more aggressive, defiant, or overly shy if both parents do not provide consistent guidance. According to certain studies, OFW kids often have trouble making positive peer relationships and may grow up feeling insecure or low on self-esteem. Furthermore, some children may have attachment disorders. This can affect their ability to trust others or show their emotions. As a result, they might experience behavior issues at home and school, or they may become socially withdrawn. Early intervention and emotional support are key to helping these children deal with the loss of a parent. Support from parents or peers can play a critical role in helping young people manage and alleviate this emotional burden. Apart from academic and socialization, children can also face difficulties in adjusting their emotions as a result of parental absence.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Feeling Different from Peers</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Some children of OFW parents struggle with social connections due to feelings of insecurity and shyness. They find it difficult to communicate and form friendships, making social interaction a significant obstacle. Shyness becomes more evident in the absence of parental support, especially when meeting new people. They often find it hard to talk to those they do not know well, which limits opportunities to build friendships. This difficulty in openness and vulnerability further hinders their ability to establish social relationships.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As stated by Rendeza (2017), loneliness & emotional disconnection: children of overseas foreign workers frequently experience emotional distance from their working parent. When separated from a parent for an extended time, many teenagers feel intense longing, sadness, and even confusion. Emotional disengagement and trouble trusting others can result from these emotions. Forming and maintaining meaningful friendships becomes increasingly difficult in the presence of emotional distance. When emotions remain unaddressed, issues such as anxiety or depression may arise.

            <h2>Affective Adaptation</h2>
            <p>
                The process of adjusting emotional reactions, behaviors, and perception to adapt to new challenges. It allows people to control their emotions effectively even in difficulties. Furthermore, affective adaptation is the way of balancing emotions in the face of internal and external stressors. This makes the cognitive process easy through adaptation and acceptance.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Sadness and Loneliness</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Children with OFW parents face challenges in emotional adaptation. They feel sad and anxious during the first weeks of separation and constantly miss their parents, often crying at night. They also experience loneliness and sadness, with some feeling envy toward classmates who have complete families. Feelings of being left out and incomplete without a parent are also evident. These findings show that the absence of a parent has a strong emotional impact, particularly on their identity and emotional stability.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                According to Capol et al. (2024), even with the Philippines' economic progress, most Filipino parents still choose to work overseas, putting their kids in the care of other family members. These children may experience undetected emotional difficulties as a result of this arrangement; they gradually learn to suppress their feelings and endure in silence. When a parent leaves to work overseas, it can cause a range of intense emotions, including loneliness, stress, and despair. Their feelings do not entirely disappear, though; rather, the children learn to cope with the situation, adapting their feelings to fit it, and the initial anguish or loss may lessen.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Mixed Emotions of Sadness and Inspiration</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Children with OFW parents feel sadness and longing during special occasions such as birthdays and holidays. Despite these feelings, they also express pride in their parents’ sacrifices and hard work abroad, which gives them inspiration. Some children feel sad when thinking about the hardships their parents might be facing, yet they cope by finding motivation in the sacrifices being made for their future.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Gaspan and Sasot (2024) found that children who are left behind may feel a variety of emotions at once, and their physical and emotional development may suffer as a result of their parents' absence. Due to their parents' absence, the children who are left behind frequently experience feelings of loneliness and abandonment. In an effort to support their family, the Filipino parents decide to take the chance of working overseas. Even if they provide for their family's financial requirements, particularly those of their kids, they fail to provide the right kind of emotional support and guidance. Even when their parents are not around, kids who are good at controlling their emotions typically experience less anxiety.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Longing for Parental Presence</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The absence of a parent has a significant effect on children. They need their parent’s care and presence as part of their growth and often miss them. This shows that the emotional needs of the child are affected when a parent is not physically present to provide support and affection.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                According to Alcaide et al. (2024), a large number of Filipinos have chosen to work overseas in order to meet their daily necessities because of the dearth of employment possibilities and low earnings in the Philippines. They are able to offer their children financial support, but they have failed to provide them with emotional support, so they are left to rely on themselves. The majority of Filipino children in the Philippines who have OFW parents experience mental discomfort; they are particularly vulnerable to depression because of their parents' physical absence. They might also experience feelings of loneliness, sadness, and homesickness. It is essential to comprehend these feelings since they have a direct impact on the children's general well-being; having OFW parents can have both positive and negative effects.
