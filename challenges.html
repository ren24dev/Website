            <h2>Academic Performance</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Difficulty in Concentration and Focus</h3>
            <p>
                Without parental supervision, students struggle to manage their time and complete school tasks. They must rely on self-discipline and motivation, which is difficult without reminders, support, or encouragement. As a result, many find it challenging to study, work on assignments, and stay focused, leading to academic difficulties.
                Zhang (2021) noted that parental absence negatively affects children's personal development, and material support alone cannot replace emotional guidance. Children who feel neglected may develop psychological or cognitive issues, often resulting in lower academic performance. Similarly, Mao, Zang, and Zhang (2020) emphasized that long-term parental absence leads to emotional and behavioral problems, further affecting schoolwork. Without parents to assist them, many children experience loneliness and longing—making academic responsibilities even harder to manage

            <h2>Sozialization</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Fear of Abandonment</h3>
            <p>
                Children of OFW parents often develop a fear of abandonment in their social interactions. Once they form close bonds, they become anxious that the people they care about will eventually leave them—just as their parents did when they went abroad. This constant fear makes it difficult to build and maintain meaningful relationships. Gaspan and Sansot (2024) explain that left-behind children often feel lonely and abandoned, which affects both their emotional and physical development. While OFW parents provide financial support, emotional needs are frequently overlooked. However, children who learn to manage their emotions are less likely to feel anxious despite their parents' absence.

            <h3>Barriers to Social Interaction</h3>
            <p>
                Many children of OFW parents face challenges in forming friendships due to shyness and insecurity. Without parental encouragement and guidance, they often struggle to communicate, especially with new people, leading to limited social connections. Graham and Jordan (2015) noted that children without consistent parental presence may become overly shy, aggressive, or withdrawn. Studies also suggest that OFW children may develop low self-esteem, difficulty trusting others, or attachment issues. These emotional barriers can lead to behavioral problems at home or school and hinder healthy social development. Early emotional support—from peers, guardians, or remaining caregivers—is crucial in helping them cope and build confidence.

            <h3>Feeling Different from Peers</h3>
            <p>
                Many children of OFW parents feel different from their peers, which affects how they socialize. Insecurity and shyness often hold them back from initiating conversations or forming friendships—especially without parental encouragement. Meeting new people becomes intimidating, and the fear of being judged or misunderstood leads to social withdrawal. Rendeza (2017) explains that prolonged separation from a parent can lead to loneliness and emotional disconnection. Teenagers often experience longing, sadness, and confusion, which may cause difficulty trusting others. When these emotions are left unaddressed, they can lead to anxiety or depression, making it even harder for OFW children to build and maintain meaningful friendships.

            <h2>Affective Adaptation</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Sadness and Loneliness</h3>
            <p>
                Children of OFW parents often face emotional struggles during separation. In the first weeks, many experience sadness, anxiety, and frequent crying at night. They feel incomplete without their parents, sometimes envying classmates with complete families. These emotions reveal how deeply parental absence affects their identity and emotional stability. Capol et al. (2024) explain that although parents work abroad for financial security, their children often endure unnoticed emotional pain. Many suppress their feelings and suffer in silence. Over time, they learn to adapt—not because the sadness disappears, but because they grow used to living with it.

            <h3>Mixed Emotions of Sadness and <br> Inspiration</h3>
            <p>
                During special occasions like birthdays and holidays, OFW children feel a strong longing for their parents. However, alongside sadness, they also express pride and motivation, drawing strength from their parents’ sacrifices. Gaspan and Sasot (2024) noted that left-behind children experience simultaneous emotions—loneliness, abandonment, and admiration. While financial needs are met, emotional support is often neglected. Those who develop emotional control tend to experience less anxiety in their parents’ absence.

            <h3>Longing for Parental care</h3>
            <p>
                Despite financial stability, what children long for most is their parents’ physical presence. Emotional needs—such as affection, reassurance, and companionship—remain unmet when a parent is away. Alcaide et al. (2024) found that while OFW parents provide financially, many children are left to handle their emotions alone, making them more vulnerable to depression, loneliness, and homesickness. These feelings significantly affect their emotional well-being, showing that having OFW parents can bring both positive and negative effects.
